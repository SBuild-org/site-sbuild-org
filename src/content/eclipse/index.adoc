:summary: The SBuild Eclipse Plugin integrates SBuild into the Eclipse IDE by providing a classpath container, implicit download of dependencies as well as JavaDoc and source archives, automatic recompilation and checking of buildfiles and workspace resolution of dependent projects.

The SBuild Eclipse Plugin extends your Eclipse IDE with SBuild support.

Current version is link:/releases/SBuild-Eclipse-Plugin-{eclipsepluginversion}.html[{eclipsepluginversion}].

== Description

SBuild Eclipse Plugin integrates SBuild into the Eclipse IDE.  This plugin provides various featues:

* SBuild Classpath Container - Access your SBuild project dependencies easily from Eclipse 
* Download of Missing Dependencies - Dependencies will be automatically downloaded
* Workspace Resolution - Dependencies, also open in the Eclipse Workspace can be referenced directly
* Change Detection -  Automatic update of the classpath container when the buildfile changes
* Error Markers in Buildfile Editor

These features are planned to be implemented:

* Project Introspection - Inspect the SBuild project, list targets, show plugins 
* Target Execution - Execution of SBuild targets

== Requirements

* http://eclipse.org[Eclipse 3.4] or newer
* SBuild 0.4.0 or newer

[#InstallationViaUpdateSite]
== Installation via Update-Site

Installation via Update-Site is the preferred installation routine.

*Update-Site URL: http://sbuild.tototec.de/svn/eclipse-update-site/stable*

Alternatively, you can http://sbuild.tototec.de/sbuild/projects/sbuild/files[download] the SBuild Eclipse Plugin and place it into the "dropins" folder of your Eclipse Installation.

== Eclipse Setup

To function properly, you need to tell your Eclipse the location of the SBuild installation.
Open the Eclipse Preferences -> Java -> Build Path -> Classpath Variables and add the variable `SBUILD_HOME`, pointing to the installation directory of SBuild.

[NOTE]
Mac homebrew users will find the installation path of SBuild under `/usr/local/Cellar/sbuild/${VERSION}/libexec`, e.g. `/usr/local/Cellar/sbuild/0.7.1/libexec`.


== Project Setup

=== Export the required dependencies from your buildfile

You need to export the required classpath before you can access it from within Eclipse.
See `ExportDependencies` for details.

[source,scala]
----
val dependencies = // your dependencies you want to access from within Eclipse

ExportDependencies("eclipse.classpath", dependencies)
----

Line 3 shows how to export the dependencies under the name "eclipse.classpath" (which is the preferred default).

=== Add SBuild Libraries to the Project

To add the "SBuild Libraries" classpath container to your Eclipse project, open the _Project Preferences_ -> _Java Build Path_ -> _Libraries_ and press the _Add Library..._ Button.

Choose "SBuild Libraries" and press _Next_.
In the next dialog page, you have the option to configure some settings, but normally you can just press _Finish_.
You can always reach and modify these settings later.

The configurable settings are:

* Name of SBuild buildfile
* Choose exported dependencies
* Update Policy
* Workspace Project aliases


== Have fun

*Congratulations!* 

You now have added the "SBuild Libraries" classpath container to your project.
You should see a "SBuild Libraries" entry in your _Package Explorer_.
Wenn you expand that tree node, you should see all your (exported) dependencies.
