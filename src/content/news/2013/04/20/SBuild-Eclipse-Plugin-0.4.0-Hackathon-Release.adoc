I'm happy to announce the release of the link:SBuildEclipsePlugin_0_4_0[SBuild Eclipse Plugin 0.4.0].

This version is compatible with SBuild 0.4.0 and never versions.
Although this release does not fix all classpath update issues we know about, it is a workable solution that support the latest and greatest SBuild version.

The SBuild Eclipse Plugin is available via update site: http://sbuild.tototec.de/svn/eclipse-update-site/stable

This release was made, to have an up-to-date version available for participants of the http://www.dd-eclipse.de/events/?event_id=7[3. Eclipse Hackathon].

Happy coding.

Tobias Roeser
