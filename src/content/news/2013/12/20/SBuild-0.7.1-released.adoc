:summary: Just before Christmas, we released SBuild 0.7.1 which brings minor Plugin API changes.

Just before Christmas, we announce the release of link:{path_doc_sbuild}/0.7.1/SBuild-0.7.1.html[SBuild 0.7.1].

Based on the feedback and our own experiences with the link:{path_doc_sbuild}/0.7.0/SBuild-0.7.0-PluginSystem.html[Plugin API] introduced in link:{path_doc_sbuild}/0.7.0/SBuild-0.7.0.html[SBuild 0.7.0] we made some small changes to the Plugin API. 
This is, to allow and encourage immutable plugin configurations over mutable ones. 
For a complete list of changes read the link:{path_doc_sbuild}/0.7.1/SBuild-0.7.1.html#Changelog[Changelog].

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, +
Tobias Roeser
