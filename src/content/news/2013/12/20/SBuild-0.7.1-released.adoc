Just before Christmas, we announce the release of link:/releases/SBuild-0.7.1.html[SBuild 0.7.1].

Based on the feedback and our own experiences with the link:/news/2013/12/06/The-Plugin-System-of-SBuild-0.7.0.html[Plugin API] introduced
in link:/releases/SBuild-0.7.0.html[SBuild 0.7.0] we made some small changes to the Plugin API. 
This is, to allow and encourage immutable plugin configurations over mutable ones.
