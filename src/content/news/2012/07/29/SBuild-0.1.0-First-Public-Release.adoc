I'm happy to announce, that SBuild made it's first public release: *SBuild 0.1.0*.

The purpose of this release is to have a stable foundation to base development one, so that SBuild 0.1.0 can be used to build itself as well as various other projects. 

To start, http://sbuild.tototec.de/sbuild/projects/sbuild/files[download] the SBuild Disbritution, unpack it and run `sbuild`. 
Under Windows, you might need to set the environment varible `SBUILD_HOME`.

The most important steps after this release is to gather feedback and to complete the documentation. 
For now, there is the http://sbuild.tototec.de/sbuild/projects/sbuild/wiki[Wiki] and the Scala-Doc. A DocBook-based Documentation to be released as PDF and HTML is in planning, too.

As there are many things to write about, I don't know exactly were to start. What do you want first?

* Documentation of the various features
* Documentation about the internals of SBuild
* Mini-Howtos Ã  la How to compile a Java Project
* Ant-Integration
* Documentation of Ant-Wrappers
* Migration-Examples from other Buildsytems
* Best Practices about dependency management
* Howto setup Multi-Projects
* ...

Please leave some comments or open a http://sbuild.tototec.de/sbuild/projects/sbuild/issues/new[ticket]!

Now, I wish you much fun with a powerful and fast build system for (but not limited to) the Java platform.


Best regards,

Tobias Roeser
