I'm very happy with the current state of SBuild, so I think, it is time to make a first release.

What is needed before that release? Windows batch scripts, to run SBuild under Windows as well. And of course more documentation.

As I use SBuild in various own project, it will be a very stable first release.

So, stay tuned,
