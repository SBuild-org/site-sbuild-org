// TODO: link to 0.1.1
We are happy to announce the Release of *SBuild 0.1.1*, the best SBuild you ever got. 

Among a lot of new features and improvements, the most important new features are the brand new *SBuild Eclipse Plugin*,
that provides a classpath container based on the SBuild build file and experimental workspace resolution support,
and better support for unit testing through the *JUnit* and *ScalaTest* addons. 
(The JUnit Ant task was not compatible with SBuilds Ant support.)

You can http://sbuild.tototec.de/sbuild/projects/sbuild/files[download SBuild here].

Please test this new version and don't hesitate to give feedback as comment, forum entry or bug report.

Best regards,

Tobias Roeser
