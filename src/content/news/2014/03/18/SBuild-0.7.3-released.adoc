:summary: The new SBuild 0.7.3 release comes with a fix for a sporadically blocking issue and some console output improvements.

Today, we released link:/releases/SBuild-0.7.3.html[SBuild 0.7.3]. 

This release fixes a serious blocking issue, where the sbuild application just hangs without finishing it's work.
This bug was introduced in the development cycle of SBuild 0.7.2 and is not present in earlier versions.
We recommend all users, especially those of SBuild 0.7.2, to update!

All other changes are related to the output of the commandline tool.
Especially the `--help` output now used the full terminal width.

For a complete list of changes read the link:/releases//SBuild-0.7.3.html#Changelog[Changelog].
