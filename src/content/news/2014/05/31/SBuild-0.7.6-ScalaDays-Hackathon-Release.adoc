:summary: We released SBuild 0.7.6 for a smooth ScalaDays Hackathon experience. It brings various fixed for the 0.7.x line.


Another Hackathon, another release. 
I'm happy to announce  link:/releases//SBuild-0.7.6.html[SBuild 0.7.6], the next maintenance release of the SBuild 0.7.x line.
Looks like, having some community contact is good for the project. ;-)

We finally managed to get the plugin classloading right and fixed a lot of typos in output messages all over the code base.
Also this version comes with some HTTP proxy support. Read the full link:/releases//SBuild-0.7.6.html#Changelog[changelog here].

I'm looking forward to todays Hackathon. If everything goes well, we will have a SBuild Server for the upcoming SBuild 0.8 soon.

Have fun

Tobias
