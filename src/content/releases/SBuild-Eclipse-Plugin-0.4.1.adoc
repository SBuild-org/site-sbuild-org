Changes since link:SBuild-Eclipse-Plugin-0.4.0.html[SBuild Eclipse Plugin 0.4.0]

* Fixed issues with classpath container refreshes. Now, classpath changes are properly propagated to the Eclipse workspace.
* SBuild JARs are only loaded once and the classloader is shared, which will reduce memory consumption and improve speed (class loading and JIT compiler effects).
