== How to build the website

Actually, we need some unreleased features of JBake, to build the site. Therefore, you need the latest master version of it.

TODO: Script the build of JBake master in SBuild

sbuild clean jbake
----

To test the site locally, run:

[source,scala]
----
sbuild clean serve-jbake
----

== Updating the site after a new SBuild release
