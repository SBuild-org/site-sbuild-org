= The sbuild.org website project

This project contains the sources to build the SBuild home page at http://sbuild.org.

== How to build the website

Actually, we need some unreleased features of JBake, to build the site. Therefore, you need the latest master version of it.

TODO: Script the build of JBake master in SBuild

----
sbuild clean jbake

To test the site locally, run:

----
sbuild clean serve-jbake
----

== Updating the site after a new SBuild release
